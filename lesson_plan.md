# Lesson Plan: Build a Mood2Emoji App (Intro to Text Classification)

**Topic:** Build a Mood2Emoji app (intro to text classification)  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Age Group:** 12â€“16 years  
**Goals:**  
- Introduce students to basic programming concepts and web app development.  
- Teach the fundamentals of text classification and sentiment analysis.  
- Encourage creative problem-solving and ethical thinking in AI.  

## Topics Introduced
- Programming basics: Variables, functions, conditionals, loops.  
- Web development: Using Streamlit for simple UIs.  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis with TextBlob.  
- Safety and ethics: Filtering inappropriate content.  
- Problem-solving: Debugging and iterating on code.  

## Topics in Detail
1. **Programming Basics:** Explain variables (e.g., storing user input), functions (e.g., `get_mood_emoji`), and conditionals (e.g., if polarity > 0.1).  
2. **Web Apps with Streamlit:** Show how to create input fields, buttons, and display outputs.  
3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Discuss how TextBlob calculates polarity (positive/negative scores) from text.  
4. **Safety Features:** Talk about why filtering bad words is important and how to implement simple checks.  
5. **Ethics in AI:** Discuss biases in sentiment analysis and the need for kid-safe tools.  

## Activity Explanation
- **Introduction (10 min):** Brainstorm emotions and how text conveys mood. Show examples.  
- **Demo (10 min):** Run the app, input sentences, and explain outputs.  
- **Group Coding (25 min):** Students modify the app (e.g., add new emojis or adjust thresholds).  
- **Testing and Sharing (10 min):** Test changes, discuss what worked/didn't.  
- **Reflection (5 min):** What did you learn? How could this be improved?  

## Learning Outcomes
- Students will build and customize a simple sentiment analysis app.  
- Understand basic NLP concepts and their applications.  
- Recognize the importance of safety in digital tools.  
- Gain confidence in coding and debugging.
